        warning: |
          By passing your own method to this prop, you are overriding the
          default behaviour of the SDK which is to load the OAuth URL in a new
          browser tab.

          If you override this functionality, you must use the device's browser
          to authenticate the user with OAuth. You cannot use  WebViews or
          iframes. Not only does this approach result in better security, it
          also can leverage saved passwords and password managers that the user
          has installed. It is also worth noting that many OAuth providers
          explicitly block loading their webapps in an iframe or WebView.
