# Widget Post Message Definitions for Swift

## Overview

This library defines and implements Post Message parsing and dispatching in
Swift. This is for use in Widget SDKs. The majority of this package was auto
generated by the [Widget Post Message
Definitions](https://github.com/mxenabled/widget-post-message-definitions)
project, and any modifications to a Post Message definition or handling should
be done there.
