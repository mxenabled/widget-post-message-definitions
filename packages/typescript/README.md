# Widget Post Message Definitions for TypeScript

## Overview

This project defines and implements all Post Message parsing and dispatching in
TypeScript. This is for use in Widget SDKs. The majorify of this package was
auto generated by the [Widget Post Message
Definitions](https://github.com/mxenabled/widget-post-message-definitions)
project, and any modifications to a Post Message definition or handling should
be done there.


## Development

This project is written in TypeScript. The following commands will be useful
when making changes to the source code or tests:

- `npm run build`, compile and emit output to the `dist` directory.
- `npm run lint`, run linter.
- `npm run test`, run unit tests.

If you need to modify the auto generated code, see
https://github.com/mxenabled/widget-post-message-definitions for instructions
on how to do that.
