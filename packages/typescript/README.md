# Widget Post Message Definitions for TypeScript

## Overview

This project defines and implements all Post Message parsing and dispatching in
TypeScript. This is for use in Widget SDKs. The majorify of this package was
auto generated by the [Widget Post Message
Definitions](https://github.com/mxenabled/widget-post-message-definitions)
project, and any modifications to a Post Message definition or handling should
be done there.


## Getting started

You can install this package via npm:

```
npm install --save @mxenabled/widget-post-message-definitions
```

```js
import { dispatchConnectLocationChangeEvent } from "@mxenabled/widget-post-message-definitions"

dispatchConnectLocationChangeEvent("mx://connect/memberDeleted?metadata=...", {
  onMemberDeleted: (payload) => {
    console.log(`${payload.member_guid} has been deleted`)
  }
})
```
