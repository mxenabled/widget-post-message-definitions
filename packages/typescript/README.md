be done there.

```

```js
import { dispatchConnectLocationChangeEvent } from "@mxenabled/widget-post-message-definitions"

dispatchConnectLocationChangeEvent("mx://connect/memberDeleted?metadata=...", {
  onMemberDeleted: (payload) => {
    console.log(`${payload.member_guid} has been deleted`)
  }
})
```

## Dependencies

This package does not have any depedencies with the exception of the `url`

change events. To install it:
