# Widget Post Message Definitions for TypeScript

## Overview

This project defines and implements all Post Message parsing and dispatching in
TypeScript. This is for use in Widget SDKs. The majority of this package was
auto generated by the [Widget Post Message
Definitions](https://github.com/mxenabled/widget-post-message-definitions)
project, and any modifications to a Post Message definition or handling should
be done there.


## Getting started

You can install this package via npm:

```
npm install --save @mxenabled/widget-post-message-definitions
```

```js
import { dispatchConnectLocationChangeEvent } from "@mxenabled/widget-post-message-definitions"

dispatchConnectLocationChangeEvent("mx://connect/memberDeleted?metadata=...", {
  onMemberDeleted: (payload) => {
    console.log(`${payload.member_guid} has been deleted`)
  }
})
```

## Dependencies

This package does not have any dependencies with the exception of the `url`
package, which you may need if you're parsing post message events from URL
change events.

The React Native SDK needs this package and has it as a dependency, but the Web
SDK won't and we shouldn't install or import it. This allows us to keep both
SDKs happy.

To install `url` in your project so you can parse post messages in location
change events:

```text
npm install --save url
```
